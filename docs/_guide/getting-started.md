## Install

The [Download page](/download/) has installers and archives for macOS,
Windows, and Linux.

Or build from source with [Rust](https://rustup.rs) 1.95 or newer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/crmne/fastpotify
cd fastpotify
cargo install --path .
```

On Linux, install the GUI and audio development packages. On Arch:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed alsa-lib libpulse libxkbcommon wayland
```

On Debian or Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

Fastpotify uses system fonts for scripts that its interface font does not
cover, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, and Indic
scripts. macOS and Windows include fonts for the common cases. On Linux,
install `noto-fonts` and `noto-fonts-cjk` (Arch) or `fonts-noto` and
`fonts-noto-cjk` (Debian or Ubuntu) if titles appear as empty boxes.

A desktop entry ships in `packaging/applications/fastpotify.desktop`. It
registers Fastpotify for `spotify:` links; with another Spotify client
installed, `xdg-mime default fastpotify.desktop x-scheme-handler/spotify`
picks Fastpotify.

## Sign in

Start the app and press **Sign in with Spotify**. Your browser opens Spotify's
consent page, so Fastpotify never sees your password. When the browser returns
to the app, your library loads.

Fastpotify stores a refresh token in your platform's state directory
(`~/.local/state/fastpotify` on Linux). You normally need the browser only
once per machine.

## Enable playback on this computer

Playing music *on this machine* needs a second browser approval because
Spotify authorizes streaming separately ([why](/how-it-connects/)). Open the
device menu in the player bar and select **Set up playback here**, or use
Settings. This needs Spotify Premium. Fastpotify saves the playback credential.

The computer then appears as a Spotify Connect device named **Fastpotify**.
You can rename it in Settings.

## Basics

- **Closing the window does not stop the music.** Fastpotify keeps playing
  from the system tray; reopen it from the tray icon and quit from the tray
  menu or Ctrl+Q. On macOS you can also reopen it from the Dock. Settings can
  turn this off. On Linux, including Flatpak, a desktop with a working system
  tray is required for this behavior.
- **Play and Pause fade.** With the default audio backend, music played on
  this computer can fade out when it pauses and back in when it resumes
  instead of cutting hard. Settings sets the length; it is off by default.
  Gapless transitions between songs and playback on another device are
  unchanged.
- **Play buttons show progress.** The button spins until Spotify responds.
- **Artist names are links.** Click a credited artist in the player bar to
  open their page. On `main`, for the release after 0.7.1, local playback
  preserves these links before Web API metadata arrives.
- **Common actions have shortcuts.** Space plays and pauses, Ctrl+F or `/`
  searches, and `Q` opens the queue. Ctrl+/ shows the full list.
- **Rows and cards have context menus.** Right-click a song, playlist, album,
  or artist to see actions such as queue, save, add to playlist, and copy link.
  Search's **Top result** card has the menu for the song, artist, album,
  playlist, or podcast it shows. Search shelves and filtered grids, and Home's
  playlist shortcuts, Made for you, Recently played, and top artist cards offer
  the same menus. Your own playlists include **Edit details** and **Delete**.
  On `main`, for the release after 0.7.1, Library's album, artist, and podcast
  grids and artist pages' discography and related-artist cards offer these
  menus too. Right-clicking opens the menu without starting playback.
  **Add to playlist** includes a local name filter for the playlists you can
  edit, for either one song or a selection. **New playlist** stays available
  when no names match.
  If the playlist already contains the song, Fastpotify asks before adding
  another copy.
- **Spotify links open in Fastpotify.** A `spotify:` link shared from another
  app opens its page, starting Fastpotify if it is not running. Links to
  `open.spotify.com` go through the browser first, which hands them over the
  same way. `fastpotify <link>` does the same from a terminal.
